# fuck-you-sanad
Proof of consupt of an html based page that shows up your governmental documents, information, and much more!

Why: my family and i suffered with sanad the jordanian developed e-ID application a lot because of server issues and network issues, yet alone the fact that a lot of information isn't available there, and it takes weeks to refresh.

In this repository, you can change the code to fit your own needs and add whatever you want!
Its very barebones, i know, the point is to take the design language and base you information on top of it
You can download the PDF file directly from sanad too, and just add it to the site using some sort of PDF viewer, the options are unlimited!

The repository will hopefully be updated to add more options.
